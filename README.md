### Guideline to Build a Production Prediction Application Using KNN

This application will predict how much of a product (e.g., loaves of bread, units of a product, etc.) a business should produce on any given day, based on past data and specific features that affect demand. The idea is to use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm** to make these predictions. Below is a detailed guide to help you achieve this:

---

### 1. **Define the Problem**

- You want to predict the number of products to produce daily based on certain features such as weather, holidays, and special events.
- The goal is to predict today's production quantity by looking at past production data with similar conditions using the KNN algorithm.

---

### 2. **Identify the Features**

Start by determining the important factors that affect your production demand. These factors (features) will be used to calculate the "closeness" between today's conditions and past data.

- **Weather**: How does the weather influence sales or production needs? You can quantify weather on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = bad, 5 = great).
- **Weekend/Holiday**: Whether it's a weekend or a public holiday (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **Special Events**: Events like sports games, sales, or festivals that could influence demand (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).

Example features:

- Weather: 4 (good)
- Weekend/Holiday: 1 (yes)
- Special Event: 0 (no)

---

### 3. **Collect and Prepare Historical Data**

You'll need historical data on past production quantities and the associated features (weather, weekend/holiday, special events) for those days. For example:

```
Weather  | Weekend/Holiday | Special Event | Loaves Sold
-------------------------------------------------------
  5      |        1         |       0       |    250
  3      |        0         |       1       |    200
  4      |        1         |       0       |    220
  ...
```

Each row represents a day’s condition and how many products (e.g., loaves of bread) were sold. This is your **training data** for the KNN algorithm.

---

### 4. **Feature Scaling**

Since your features (weather, weekend/holiday, special events) may have different ranges, you should normalize or scale the data so that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations. This ensures that one feature (e.g., weather) doesn't dominate others (e.g., weekend/holiday).

- **Normalize** or **standardize** your features to values between 0 and 1 or use standard scaling (mean = 0, variance = 1).

---

### 5. **KNN Algorithm Overview**

KNN works by finding the "k" closest points in the training data to your current day’s conditions (based on weather, weekend/holiday, and special events) and averaging their production values to make a prediction.

Steps:

- **Define k**: This is the number of nearest neighbors to look for. You can experiment with different values of k (e.g., k=3, k=4, k=5).
- **Calculate distances**: For each day in your historical data, compute how close its features are to today’s features using a distance formula (e.g., Euclidean distance).
- **Find the k nearest neighbors**: Sort your historical data by distance, and select the top k nearest days.
- **Average the production**: Take the average of the production values for the k nearest neighbors to make your prediction.

---

### 6. **Calculate Distances (Euclidean Distance)**

Use the Euclidean distance formula to measure how "close" a past day’s conditions are to today’s. The formula for the distance between two points (days) with three features (weather, weekend/holiday, special event) is:

\[
\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2}
\]

Where:

- \(x_1, x_2, x_3\) are today’s feature values (e.g., weather, weekend/holiday, special event).
- \(y_1, y_2, y_3\) are the feature values for a past day in your historical data.

---

### 7. **Find the Nearest Neighbors**

- Calculate the distance between today’s conditions and each day in the historical dataset.
- Sort the distances in ascending order.
- Select the top **k** closest neighbors (the days with the smallest distances).

---

### 8. **Make the Prediction**

- Once you have the k nearest neighbors, take the average of their production values (e.g., the number of loaves of bread sold) to predict today’s production quantity.
- Example:
  - Suppose you found 4 nearest neighbors, and their respective production values were 200, 250, 180, and 240.
  - Your predicted production for today would be:
    \[
    \text{Prediction} = \frac{200 + 250 + 180 + 240}{4} = 217.5
    \]
  - You should produce around 218 units today.

---

### 9. **Test and Validate**

- Test your model with different values of **k** to see which gives the best results. Start with k=3 or k=4 and adjust based on your validation data.
- Validate your model by comparing the predicted production values with actual data and adjusting the feature importance or scaling as necessary.

---

### 10. **Refine the Model**

- Experiment with more features if needed (e.g., promotions, school holidays, time of year).
- You can also explore weighting the nearest neighbors if you believe closer points should have more influence on the prediction (weighted KNN).

---

### Summary of Steps:

1. Define the important features (e.g., weather, holiday, event).
2. Collect and prepare historical data.
3. Normalize the data.
4. Choose a value for k (number of neighbors).
5. Calculate the distance between today's conditions and past days.
6. Find the k nearest neighbors.
7. Average the production values of those neighbors to make the prediction.

This approach gives you a data-driven way to predict daily production based on past conditions using KNN.
